I decided for my Data Analysis course that I had done through the University of College Dublin, I would analyze the Indian Premier League. I'm a big sport guy, and a
big fan of the IPL. The data source I wanted to analyze, was the auction data for the teams. It was for the last 10 editions, 2013 to 2022.  

I found the data on Kaggle (kaggle.com/datasets). During the course I was exposed to Pandas, Matlib and Seaborn, learning how to manipulate data and vizualize it. 

The course also wanted us to Webscrape data, using a API or link to the data, but I decided that I would include a SQL database. I started investigating this and found 
that Microsoft Azure had a trial option.  
I created a Azure SQL Server. The SQL server contained a database of 11 tables,each table shows the standings for the year. The 11th table was the team identifier table.
The tables would show the Team, their position, how many games they won, lost, tied and the no results (rained out). 
I unfortunately couldn't include the SQL version as my trial expired and as a result I had to change my code a bit to include a second Excel file.

The Excel file has 11 sheets, the same as the SQL server. 

I really enjoyed applying everything I learned. The best learning was running into a problem or piece of code that didn't do what I had expected and Googling to find a
solution.
